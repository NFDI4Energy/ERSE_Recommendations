# Recommendations for Engineering Research Software in Energy Research

This repository aims to forster a discussion on recommendations for energy research software engineering (ERSE). Since Energy Research Software is an important foundation for energy research, its quality highly influences the quality of energy research. Therefore, we developed multiple recommendations for the engineering and development of research software in the energy domain. 
We published our first version of recommendations in [the ACM e-Energy](https://doi.org/10.1145/3679240.3734606} (Currently only a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13510) is available.)

The current version of all recommendations is presented in the recommendations folder in this repository.

## Collaboration
We believe that there are a lot of good ideas and practical recommendations for the engineering of energy research software out there. Therefore, we invite you to add your comments and ideas in our [discussion section](https://github.com/NFDI4Energy/ERSE_Recommendations/discussions).
Based on the discussion, we will update the recommendations in this repository.
