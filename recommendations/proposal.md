## Good software development needs resources

#### Background

Energy research is mainly funded through research projects. Since
software engineering is often a big part of research projects it should
also be covered in project proposals. Including software engineering
aspects in proposals enables researchers working on research projects to
develop better research software . Many of the aspects already mentioned
can be included in a research project proposal.

#### Recommendations

Within a proposal, we recommend emphasizing reusing existing frameworks
instead of developing new solutions as introduced in
reuseAndExtend. Even if the reuse of existing software
is planned, it is recommended to include some resources for maintaining
and adapting the existing software.

Sometimes, it is still necessary to develop new software. In these
cases, libraries that can be easily integrated into other software are
better suited than complicated frameworks. Additionally, we recommend to
formulate an overall software strategy, including a software management
plan (see [^1]). This should include the different
development aspects during the research project, e.g., testing. Also,
this strategy should cover how the software can be reused after the
project. Sometimes, other research groups can even write letters of
interest for reusing the software. As discussed in
reuseAndExtend, we recommend choosing the licenses
early, which can already be part of the proposal.

Especially in energy research, research projects often include
cooperation with industry partners. In these cases, we recommend finding
a common solution for licensing with all involved partners within the
research project proposal. In such cases, it can also be helpful to
include resources for legal aspects of the software in the research
project proposal.

When new software is developed, relevant resources should be included in
the research project proposal. Besides sufficient resources for the
general development of the software, including essential steps such as
testing and documenting the software, this should also take usability
aspects into account since the software should be reusable for other
researchers. To achieve reuse, planning resources for community
interaction as described in
community is also helpful. Since most researchers are
not trained in RSE,
resources for training and networking with other research software
engineers are recommended.

Software development plays an important role in research projects. By
including different RSE aspects in the research project proposal,
it becomes easier to cover software engineering aspects and follow our
recommendations within a research project.

**Include RSE in your research project proposals!**
